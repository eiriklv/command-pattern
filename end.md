(Hiring PHP/JavaScript: Clojure and/or Haskell to come)

Note:

That's all I've got! If you want to follow me on the social medias, here's my blog and twitter handle.
The slides for the talk are posted at this link.
Finally, Seller Labs is hiring -- we're primarily looking for Laravel/React developers right now, but you'll have the opportunity to get into Clojure and/or Haskell down the road.

Does anyone have any questions?
