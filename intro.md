# Design Patterns

## From Abstract Math


*TODO: bg: cover of "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Software"*

Note:

Design pattern is a term popularized by the Gang of Four book containing a
whole bunch of different software design elements that they recognized while
working on big enterprise software. Examples include:


*TODO: bg: factory*

Note:

The factory pattern, where you restrict instantiation of objects so you can have more control over their creation.


*TODO: bg: visitor*

Note:

The visitor pattern, which allows you to consolidate the logic around traversing multiple similar cases.


*TODO: bg: command*

Note:

The command pattern, where you separate the logic behind deciding what actions to do and executing those actions.


*TODO: bg: supercharged java bean*

Note:

I'm going to talk about stuff that common languages might not be able to
implement as first class language features.

Where it makes the examples easier to understand, I'm going to assume language
features that don't exist, like standalone implementation of interfaces and
abstractions of generics.


## "The choice of programming language is important because it influences one's point of view. 

### Our patterns assume Smalltalk and C++ level language features, and that choice determines what can and cannot be implemented easily.

### If we assumed procedural languages, we might have included design patterns called "Inheritance," "Encapsulation," and "Polymorphism." 

## Similarly, some of our patterns are supported directly by the less common object-oriented languages."
