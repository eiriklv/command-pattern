# Design Patterns

## From Abstract Math

Note:

Design pattern is a term popularized by the Gang of Four book containing a
whole bunch of different software design elements that they recognized while
working on big enterprise software. Examples include:

Note:

The factory pattern, where you restrict instantiation of objects so you can have more control over their creation.


<!-- .slide: data-background="visitor-pattern.jpg" -->

Note:

The visitor pattern, which allows you to consolidate the logic around traversing multiple similar cases.


<!-- .slide: data-background="command-pattern.gif" -->

Note:

The command pattern, where you separate the logic behind deciding what actions to do and executing those actions.

Note:

I'm going to talk about stuff that common languages might not be able to
implement as first class language features.


## "The choice of programming language is important because it influences one's point of view. 

### Our patterns assume Smalltalk and C++ level language features, and that choice determines what can and cannot be implemented easily.

### If we assumed procedural languages, we might have included design patterns called "Inheritance," "Encapsulation," and "Polymorphism." 

## Similarly, some of our patterns are supported directly by the less common object-oriented languages."
